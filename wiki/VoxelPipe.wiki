= Introduction =

This is *VoxelPipe*, a voxelization library built in CUDA by
*NVIDIA Research*.

Details about the employed algorithms are given in:

 * "VoxelPipe: A Programmable Pipeline for 3d Voxelization", Jacopo Pantaleoni, High Performance Graphics 2011 - August 2011
  (http://research.nvidia.com/publication/voxelpipe-programmable-pipeline-3d-voxelization)

VoxelPipe references the NIH library available at:
http://code.google.com/p/slash-sandbox/

The main header file defining the high level API for the library is
src/voxelpipe/voxelpipe.h (http://code.google.com/p/voxelpipe/source/browse/trunk/src/voxelpipe/voxelpipe.h)

The rest of the top-level src/voxelpipe directory is implementation specific,
and is not for the weak of heart.
